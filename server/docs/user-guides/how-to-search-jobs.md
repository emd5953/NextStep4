# How to Search for Jobs on NextStep

## Overview
NextStep uses AI-powered semantic search to help you find relevant jobs. Unlike traditional job boards that only match keywords, our search understands context and meaning.

## Search Methods

### 1. Natural Language Search
You can search like you're talking to a person:
- "remote software engineer jobs in Chicago"
- "entry level marketing positions"
- "full stack developer with React experience"
- "data analyst jobs paying over 80k"

### 2. Simple Keyword Search
Traditional keyword search also works:
- "software engineer"
- "marketing"
- "data analyst"

### 3. Browse All Jobs
Leave the search box empty to see all available jobs.

## How Semantic Search Works

### What Makes It Special
Our AI understands:
- **Synonyms:** "developer" = "engineer" = "programmer"
- **Related skills:** "React" relates to "JavaScript", "frontend"
- **Context:** "remote" understands "work from home", "distributed"
- **Intent:** "entry level" finds junior positions

### Example Searches

**Instead of:** "software engineer"
**Try:** "backend developer with Python experience in San Francisco"

**Instead of:** "marketing"
**Try:** "digital marketing specialist for tech startups"

**Instead of:** "data"
**Try:** "data scientist with machine learning experience"
