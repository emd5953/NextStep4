## Job Search

### "I can't find any jobs in my area"
Try these:

### "The job I want disappeared"
If you swiped left (passed), it won't show again. If you swiped right (applied), check "My Jobs" to see your application.

### "Can I see jobs I passed on?"
No, once you swipe left, that job won't appear again. Be careful when swiping!
