# How to Check Your Progress on NextStep

## Overview
Want to see how your job search is going? NextStep provides several ways to track your progress and see how you're doing.

## Where to Check Your Progress

### 1. My Jobs Page
**What it shows:** All your job applications and their status

**How to access:**
1. Click "My Jobs" in the navigation menu
2. You'll see a table with all your applications

**What you'll see:**
- **Job Title** - The position you applied for
- **Company** - Who you applied to
- **Date Applied** - When you submitted your application
- **Status** - Where you are in the process:
  - **Pending** - Employer is reviewing your application
  - **Interviewing** - You're in the interview process! 🎉
  - **Offered** - You got a job offer! 🎊
  - **Rejected** - Not moving forward with this one
- **Notes** - Your personal notes about each application

### 2. Application Statistics

**Total Applications:**
Count the rows in your "My Jobs" table to see how many jobs you've applied to.

**Success Rate:**
- Count how many are "Interviewing" or "Offered"
- Divide by total applications
- Example: 3 interviews out of 10 applications = 30% response rate

**Active Applications:**
Count applications with status "Pending" or "Interviewing" - these are still in progress!

### 3. Messenger Activity

**Check your messages:**
1. Go to "Messenger" page
2. See which employers have contacted you
3. Unread messages mean employers are interested!

**Good signs:**
- Multiple messages from an employer
- Interview scheduling requests
- Follow-up questions about your experience

### Keep Notes
Use the "Notes" field in "My Jobs" to track:

- Next steps

## Understanding Response Times

### Normal Timeline
- **Application submitted** → Wait 3-7 days
- **Status changes to "Interviewing"** → Employer will message you
- **Interview completed** → Wait 1-2 weeks for decision
- **Offer received** → You have 1-2 weeks to decide

### When to Follow Up
- **After 1 week** - If status is still "Pending"
- **After interview** - Send thank you within 24 hours
- **After 2 weeks** - Follow up on interview decision

### Don't Worry If...
- You don't hear back immediately (employers are busy!)
