.Found Deprecation Modules error. onAfterSetupMiddlewawre and onBeforeSetupMiddleware
 However, these do not affect the application to run.
.Maybe we should not let users sign up if the email is not a valid one.
 Add authentication with email such as (one time codes) 
.Upload resume storage. HOW?
.Location submitted then use gps type thing to be able to shortlist with location preference.
 Maybe some feautre that has the location bar to automatically fillup
 suggestions. maybe its a google feautre?
.Profile Page only has upload photo, resume, name, number, email, location
 add more features, make it look pretty
 Unsatisfied with UI and color, talk to group members for a theme. Reference other UI on internet
 Profile page should have option to either upload or link certifcations.
 Link certification through the actual certification provider or just upload?
 Add preference filter. brainshop how this would be?
.Signups do not get stored in the database? Only stored in db when 
 profile is created when they reach profile AFTER they sign up
.Database does not store timestamps of users logins, signups, registrations.
 Also have logs?
